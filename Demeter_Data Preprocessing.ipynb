    "Other data source does not collected data at different levels. For example, restaurants and childcare data don't seperate the area Point Cook as Point Cook - South, Point Cook - North, and Point Cook - West. We could potentially extract boundaries from the Census SA2 shapefile and then create functions to category the data into different sub-areas. However, this approach does not align with the purpose of the application and the common suburb naming convention. To provide an intuitive and easy way to understand subrubs for the users, we need to keep the data at a higher level. "
